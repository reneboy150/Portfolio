About me
-Hello there, I'm Rene Boy, and I'm delighted 
to welcome you to my corner of the internet. 
Here's a little glimpse into who I am and what 
drives me. Who Am I? I'm a Computer Engineering 
Student in CITE Technical Institute, Inc. From a 
young age, I've been captivated by Computer games, 
and other technological stuff, and my journey in 
this field has been nothing short of exhilarating. 
With great interest in the field, I've honed my skills 
and developed deep understanding of Coding/Programming. 
What I Stand For Beyond the professional realm, I'm a 
firm believer in the Catholic faith. Everywhere I go, 
these principles guides me in both my personal and 
professional life. Life Beyond Work When I'm not doing 
my work, you can find me playing online games and 
basketball. These pursuits add a colorful dimension 
to my life and keep my creativity flowing. I am thrilled 
to share my journey with you and eager to learn from 
yours. Let's connect, exchange ideas, and build a community 
where we can inspire and support each other.
